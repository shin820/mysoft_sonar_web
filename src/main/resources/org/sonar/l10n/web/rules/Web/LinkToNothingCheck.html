<p>
There are 2 known patterns to build a link that has the sole purpose to run JavaScript code:
</p>

<pre>
&lt;a href="#" onclick="alert('Clicked!'); return false;"&gt;Run JavaScript Code&lt;/a&gt;
</pre>

<p>and</p>

<pre>
&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="alert('Clicked!'); return false;"&gt;Run JavaScript Code&lt;/a&gt;
</pre>

<p>
The goal of this rule is to ban such patterns in order to keep on supporting browsing with JavaScript disabled.
